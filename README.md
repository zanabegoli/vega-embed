To build vega-embed and view the test examples, you must have yarn installed.

1. Run yarn in the Vega-Embed folder to install dependencies.
2. Run yarn build.
3. Run a local webserver with yarn start then point your web browser at the main.html


Open the Web Page
You will find yourself on the first page (main.html), with the general visualisations 
which youcan interact with by shifting the month slider underneath. 
Once done, you can navigate to other pages by scrolling down and choosing options 
to compare different particles. ammonium.html, dis_oxy.html, nitrite.html, nn.html,
phosphate.html, and silicate.html take you to each particle's chart which compares the 
values of the selected particle to all the other present condtitions at that time, by
selecting a region within a chart which wants to be tested. 
Once you go back, you can also take a look at the third visualisation by opening
test1.html or clicking on the Ammonium vs. Phosphate link, which takes you to a specific
comparison between these two particles. You can select a region on the Ammonium chart to
get an insight into the Phosphate details.
